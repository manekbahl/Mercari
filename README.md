In recent years, the online marketplace has grown tremendously, persuading even the
small-scale sellers to sell their products through these websites.
Mercari is a startup that operates Japan’s No.1 marketplace application and is also the
country’s only unicorn company (with a pre-IPO valuation of over 100 billion yen)! Recently,
Mercari have been increasing its user base overseas, and its app has now been downloaded over
90 million times! Mercari’s marketplace provides a platform for users to buy and sell easily from
their smartphones. The main problem faced by the company is that since the website is open for
everyone to sell their products, it has become increasingly difficult to actually know what
something is really worth. To this end, they’d like to offer pricing suggestions to the sellers, but
this is tough because their sellers are enabled to put just about anything, or any bundle of things,
on Mercari's marketplace.

The challenge with product pricing is that the different categories of products have
different pricing patterns. For example, clothing has strong seasonal pricing trends and is heavily
influenced by brand names, while electronics have fluctuating prices based on product specs.
In this paper, we describe how we are going to predict the price of the product based on
the information provided to us, giving importance to the product description which might hold
key feature for price prediction.

In this project we try to use various NLP techniques and redictive algorithms to predict the 
correct price of an item based on various features provided by Mercari.
